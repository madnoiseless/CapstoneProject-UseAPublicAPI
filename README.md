* Supports different joke types, such as "twopart" jokes with a setup and delivery.
* Provides a button to fetch and display another joke.

## Technologies Used

* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.
* Express: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
